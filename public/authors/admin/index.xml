      <description>Introduction Research Idea For this project I will research the racial differences and disparities in American economics, politics, and culture. I will use statistical analysis to look for correlations in these differences. The independent variable will be race and the dependent variables will be family income, political party, and average amount of TV somebody watches.
 The GSS Dataset The dataset is from the General Social Survey (GSS). It is a national survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, to gather data on the complexity of American life.</description>
