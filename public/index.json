The regression shows that an increase in age by 1 year results in a 0.04 increase in the hours of TV someone watches. An increase in income by 1,000 is associated with 0.015 decrease in the amount of TV one watches. However; the R-squared value shows that these variables only explain 10% of the data observations. From this data we can also compare the mean hours of TV each race watches.\n\r\rInferences\rFrom the social survey data one can analyze racial differences within the United States. A boxplot was used to compare the Family Income averages across races. This revealed that black people have the lowest average wages and speaks to a larger culture of income inequality within the United States. These economic differences effected the racial makeup of America’s political parties. Democrats were the most racially diverse, while Independent was the most popular. After looking at economic and political differences we anlayzed the niche cultural difference of hours of TV watched. Across all races hours of TV increased with age but when split by race it was clear that blakc people watch more TV than the other races. This anlaysis helps understand how one’s race is likely to correlate with economic, political, and cultural differences in the United States.\n\r","date":1543881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543881600,"objectID":"0eba5a9823a2e1aa0e2346538c279224","permalink":"/post/gss-data-project/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gss-data-project/","section":"post","summary":"Research Proposal\rFor this project I will research the racial differences and disparities in American economics, politics, and culture.

There seems to be a lot of outliers in this visualization.\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price))+\rgeom_histogram()+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Diamond Price Histogram\u0026quot;)\rI decided to make a histogram of diamond price to get a better understanding of the first boxplot.

This histogram helps to explain the unexpected results in the first boxplot. The reason why fair diamonds have the highest average price while ideal diamonds have the lowest has to do with quantity. There are far more ideal diamonds than fair. This also explains the large number of outliers in the boxplot. The cut of the diamond cannot be used to predict price. Perhaps the carat would have a better linear relationship with price? To explore this I will create a scatterplot of the carat and price.\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x= carat,y = price))+\rgeom_point()+\rgeom_smooth(color= \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, se=FALSE)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Diamond Carat and Price Scatter Plot\u0026quot;)\rWhile there are still many outliers there is a stronger linear relationship between carat and price than cut and price.\n\rResults\rThe diamonds dataset contains information about the price and quality of diamonds. The data shows that the price of diamonds is not correlated with the cut of the diamond. After looking at a histogram it is apparent that this is due to skew in the frequency of the diamonds by cut. There are significantly more Premium and Ideal diamonds than Fair and Good. This is an interesting result that one would not expect. It turns out that the carat of the diamond is a better predictor of price. As the carat goes up so does the price. However; there are not many diamonds that are over three carats in the data. Anyone familiar with diamonds would expect a higher carat to be associated with a higher quality and price, this data supports this expectation.\n\r","date":1538611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538611200,"objectID":"86abcc791d45b260697966582598e054","permalink":"/post/eda-project/","publishdate":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/eda-project/","section":"post","summary":"For this post I decided to walk through the steps of exploratory data analysis using the diamonds dataset that come with base R.\nPlotting the Data\rdata(\u0026#39;diamonds\u0026#39;) #Loading the dataset\rsummary(diamonds) #Looking at the summary of the dataset\r## carat cut color clarity ## Min. :0.2000 Fair : 1610 D: 6775 SI1 :13065 ## 1st Qu.:0.4000 Good : 4906 E: 9797 VS2 :12258 ## Median :0.7000 Very Good:12082 F: 9542 SI2 : 9194 ## Mean :0.","tags":["R Markdown","ggplot2","tidyverse"],"title":"Exploratory Data Analysis with Diamonds","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":null,"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database.
