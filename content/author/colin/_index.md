bio: I am an undergraduate student at Emory University. I am currently a Technology Consultant at Emory's Cox Computing Center. Data Analytics is my passion, and R programming is my bread and butter. I am interested in Econometrics, Data Privacy, and Business Intelligence. I believe we are in the midst of a data revolution that will define our future, meaning that we have the responsibility to shape what that future looks like through responsible data practices. When I'm not behind a computer screen, I enjoy spending time in nature and taking care of my plants.
